## Setup Instructions

* Install all dependencies, and you should be good to go.

## BDD
Using a key, which is an integer between 1 and 25, This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC".

3. This a WIP and more technologies will be added as we go. 


## Live Link
