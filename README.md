## BDD
Using a key, which is an integer between 1 and 25, This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC".
   
## Technologies Used
1. Project built purely using reactJS.
2. VS Code
3. This is a WIP and more technologies to be be added as we go.
